# Text-To-Speech-in-Indian-Languages
Implementation of Text to Speech in 6 different Indian Languages in a webpage (using Django Rest Framework).

The whole world is going digital. Money transfers from one bank account to another, creating a bank account, online shopping, online tutorial classes are only few of the numerous services that a common man can use it to their fullest advantage. But of what purpose is it, if the end user is not able to read the text written in English on the webpage, simply because the person doesn't know to read or understand English. This project aims to tackle this very issue, by translating the contents of the page in the selected language. It also has a text to speech feature, where the browser speaks in the selected language.
